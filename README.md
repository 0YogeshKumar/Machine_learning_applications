# Machine_learning_applications

It looks like you've provided two Jupyter notebooks: `House_Price.ipynb` and `Student_Depression.ipynb`. This gives me a much clearer idea of your repository's content\!

Here's an attractive `readme.md` for your "Machine Learning Applications" repository, incorporating details from both notebooks:

## üéØ Projects Included

### üè° House Price Regression

This project focuses on building and evaluating a linear regression model to predict house prices.

  * **Objective**: To accurately predict house prices based on various features of properties.
  * **Methodology**:
      * Data Loading and Preprocessing
      * Feature Engineering (One-hot encoding, Standardization)
      * Linear Regression Model Training
      * Performance Evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R¬≤)
      * Visualization of predictions and residuals
  * **Key Learnings**: Understanding the complete workflow of a regression problem, from data preparation to model interpretation.
  * **Technologies**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### üßë‚Äçüéì Student Depression Analysis

This project delves into analyzing a dataset related to student depression to understand contributing factors and potentially build a predictive model.

  * **Objective**: To identify key factors influencing student mental health and analyze depression trends among students.
  * **Dataset Features**: Demographics (Gender, Age, City), Academic and Work Pressure, Study and Job Satisfaction, Sleep Duration, Dietary Habits, Degree and Profession, Financial Stress, Family History of Mental Illness, Suicidal Thoughts, and Depression Status (target).
  * **Key Learnings**: Exploratory data analysis, understanding the impact of various socio-economic and lifestyle factors on mental health, and insights into building classification models for health-related outcomes.
  * **Technologies**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `re`, `scikit-learn` (for potential future modeling)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore these projects, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0YogeshKumar/Machine_learning_applications.git
    cd Machine_learning_applications
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Each notebook has its own set of requirements listed within. You can install the common ones or specific ones as needed.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
    *(Refer to individual notebooks for any additional specific requirements.)*
4.  **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a browser window with the Jupyter interface, where you can navigate to and open `House_Price.ipynb` or `Student_Depression.ipynb`.
